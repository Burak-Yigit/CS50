# Aim

After years I've finally decided to learn how to write code and I thought using this platform will help me achieve my goals. By doing so I will also share my knowledge with all by sharing all the notes I take. I believe this job, coding requires lots of energy, joy and ambition. Without having one of these will let you down and in the end you will not have anything left in your hand.

I'll arrange these notes later. Now, I am focusing on learning the basics.
